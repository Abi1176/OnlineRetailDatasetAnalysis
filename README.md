**Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis**

For customer segmentation we use Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis to segment customers:

**Recency (R)**: How recently a customer made a purchase

**Frequency (F)**: How often a customer buys

**Monetary (M)**: How much a customer spends


**K-Means Clustering:**

Using this algorithm customers were categorized into:

**High-Value Buyers** – Frequent, high-spending customers

**Occasional Buyers** – Moderate spending & purchase frequency

**One-Time Shoppers** – Rare purchases, low spending

**Lost Customers**– Haven’t purchased recently
